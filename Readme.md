1- In this work we crawled data from CWE website (http://cwe.mitre.org/data/index.html).
2- The collected dataset was related to the security vulnerabilities in software.
3- Every year (almost), CWE publishes a list of the most dangrous security vulnerabilities reported worldwide.
4- We retrieved these lists and take every single vulnerability, then, we looked for its relations to the vulnerabilities (even they are not classified as dangrous).
5- More about the work can be found in the published paper:
  http://journal.uob.edu.bh/handle/123456789/4137
6- The dataset was uploaded for the years 2004 to 2017. It can be directly used on Gephi.
